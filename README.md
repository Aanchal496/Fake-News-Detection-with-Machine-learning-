# Fake-News-Detection-with-Machine-learning-
STEPS INVOLVED
1. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
2. DATA VISULAIZATION OF WORDS (WITH VARIOUS CHARTS)
3. DATA PRE-PROCESSING
4. ML MODELLING (CONFUSION MATRIX)

Problem Statement : Identifying which news is fake and which is real and also checking the accuracy of fake and real news in the data

1. Graphical representation of words, character count, stopwords, total numeric count, different types of news category, most common words 
2. Converting text to lowercase and removing punctuations , stopwords, special characters, numeric values , rarely used words and whitespaces.
3. Performing lemmatization
4. From CountVectorizer we create bag of words 
5. Converting text into numerical format with the help of tf-idf
6. Confusion matrix (Decision tree classifier, random tree classifier , logistic regression)
